# Chapter 20: Epilogue

*The end is here, just to start again.*

You made it, congrats. :)

Nineteen chapters. From bit to Bitcoin. From light switches to global coordination technology.

Thank you for trusting me to guide you through this journey.

Now, let me close this book with some final words to give you an even deeper insight on how this technology can and cannot affect our lives.

## Why I Wrote This

I had an interview on a YouTube channel to explain potential use cases of this new technology. There, I realized there was no middle ground: either you stay too vague (trying to hide complexity) and people think you're a scammer, or you use technical words and no one understands you.

I must admit my communication skills are poor when talking about technical things to non-technical audiences. Yet even beyond my limitations, I felt the industry had no proper way of truly explaining things:

**The impossible communication problems:**

- **"Bitcoin is a digital asset."** (That's half the story at best—remember, we interpret the information)

- **"Blockchain networks."** (What the hell is that? Even computer science students need time to understand a blockchain data structure. How can everyday people hear that word and intuitively grasp it?)

- **"Where should I invest?"** (That question always appears, but again, it's only half the story. People care about money, not use cases. Even if I tried to answer, how do I properly explain the risk differences between a cryptocurrency coded at the blockchain level versus at the smart contract level?)

- **The contradiction trap:** You say things like "crypto is controlled by no one, like Ethereum," but then you say "some crypto ON Ethereum are controlled"? You sound contradictory. People think you're an impostor. (Now you understand how both statements are true simultaneously.)

- **The foundation problem:** People don't know what the internet really is. If they don't know that, how will they understand something as complex as a CDN?

- **The double-ignorance problem:** People—at least in my country, Spain—have little to no knowledge about finance, combined with little knowledge about how to think properly about modern technologies like computers. The result? They have no chance of feeling comfortable thinking about something that combines both. You try to find analogies with mechanics they do understand, but as you've seen, this technology's complexity means your analogy will always be incomplete. Furthermore, because this technology enables genuinely new capabilities, there may simply be no good analogy for them. And when people notice the gaps or contradictions in your explanations, they won't trust you. Again, you sound like an impostor.

I received lots of criticism about this in YouTube comments, and about my poor communication skills for technical topics. That was mainly because my brain was facing all these complexities in real time.

**I realized:** If we really want people to feel comfortable with "crypto," we cannot skip the complexity. We must break it down as much as possible and teach it. So we don't sound like scammers no matter what we say.

Therefore, here I am, writing this book.

### The Emotional Barrier

You cannot make people feel comfortable and rational about something new and complex when you trigger their emotions toward something as political and real as money.

Especially in a struggling country like mine, where people fight to make ends meet and quality of life has been decreasing or stagnant for the last 25 years. [FACT CHECK: "quality of life decreasing or stagnant for 25 years in Spain" - verify with economic data] Money is not a joke—especially after so many crises, scammers selling useless courses, everyone trying to waste your money online. If someone tries to explain new things honestly and for free, people distrust you too, because that's exactly how scammers look at first. They gain your trust, then trick you into paying.

I could not figure out another way around this than to improve my communication skills and write this book. The second, as you see, is done.

### The Book's Goal

This book's main goal: **teach people to think correctly about these new technologies that shape and influence our lives, from the bit to Bitcoin, so they can know what they are and how to use them safely.**

I tried to abstract away technical jargon as much as possible. When necessary, I provided intuitive explanations first so you can think about each concept as a piece, a tool, with certain features and uses in other systems.

**The deeper goal:** The ability to think clearly about complex topics. The ability to evaluate claims critically. The ability to see through buzzwords and ask the right questions. I hope you got a feeling for that in this book, and I hope you can extrapolate this to other fields in life.

## The Iron Law of Oligarchy - Why Education Matters

I'll finish with a conclusion from a German sociologist from the last century, Robert Michels, that I think applies powerfully to this new technology.

In his book *"Political Parties: A Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy"*, he analyzed how democratic organizations at scale—even those with honest and good intentions—tend to become oligarchies over time. [FACT CHECK: Robert Michels book title and thesis - verify exact title and publication date] Power concentrates in the hands of a few, and the original ideals of the group are often compromised.

**CDNs are nothing other than big organizations at scale.** Will they face the same fate Robert Michels analyzed in all human coordination? Will new technologies help us avoid the oligarchical tendencies of human organizations?

Likely not. **But they will make everything more transparent, auditable, and harder to hide from the public eye.** Oligarchies aren't bad on their own—they're bad when they contradict and go against the people they're supposed to represent.

Transparency, speed of information availability, and auditability are powerful tools against these cases. They create a more powerful, more informed public that can quickly align their unavoidable oligarchs with their original goals.

At the very last pages of the second edition of his book, he wrote:

> *A broader education gives people a greater capacity to exercise oversight and control. We see every day that among the wealthy, however great, the authority of leaders over their followers is never as unrestricted as it is among the poor. In the mass, the poor are powerless and defenseless before their leaders. Their intellectual and cultural inferiority makes it impossible for them to understand where the leader is taking them or to foresee the importance of his actions. Therefore, the great task of social education is to raise the intellectual level of the masses so that, as far as possible, they can counteract the oligarchical tendencies of the working-class movement.*

[FACT CHECK: Robert Michels quote - verify this is an accurate translation from the second edition]

He mainly analyzed the working class socialist movement of his era, but he made clear these patterns remain true across contexts. The general trait: democratic human organizations at scale tend to form oligarchies.

### The Oligarchy of Nerds

**We, the nerds—the ones who build the code, who can read the code, who can write the code—will become a strong oligarchy if this technology is massively adopted.** And because we need lots of nerds to build such a massive codebase, we will have an oligarchy inside the oligarchy.

That is unavoidable. If you want to know more about why, read Robert's book. It was written 100 years ago but feels as if it were written today. [FACT CHECK: "written 100 years ago" - verify publication date of Michels' book]

**We must educate what Robert calls "the masses"—the everyday people—so they can question us and make the system even more resilient to corruption and power abuse.** By design, CDNs are very resistant. But design alone isn't enough.

Remember the Ethereum DAO hack that led to a fork? Some critics of the "reverse the hack" option said: *"This is only happening because a big figure in the group, the creator Vitalik Buterin, is positioning himself toward that option. What kind of consensus is this? The consensus of one man?"*

They were sharp in this observation. This is just one of many oligarchic tendencies humans have by nature. Usually the masses (all node runners) don't have as much technical knowledge as the leaders, and they sort of "blindly" trust their opinions and follow them.

Yes, the community decided. But to what extent was this decision influenced by oligarchic tendency? Is this really consensus?

**Here is the deepest and most complex real risk of the industry right now:** We need more nerds and even more importantly, we need people to better understand what we do.

Otherwise we will become, as Robert Michels studied, an oligarchy of nerds with the potential to go against the interests of the masses.

A small spark of this phenomenon already seemed to happen.

**We do not just need you to learn for the technology to work due to technical reasons, but also due to unavoidable human social tendencies.**

This is too why I wrote this book.

## Author Permission - This Book Is Free Forever

You can copy it. Share it. Remix it. Improve it. Translate it. Fork it.

**Just like Bitcoin itself, this knowledge belongs to everyone.**

If you found value in this book, the best thing you can do is share it with people.

**Knowledge should be free. Understanding should be accessible.**

That's why I wrote this. That's why it's free forever.

We do not thrive when resources are scarce, and knowledge is a resource.

## Why This Matters Beyond Technology

Societies that trust each other generate more wealth. Knowledge is a resource. We do not thrive when resources are scarce.

Those who understand and carefully explore this new technology will have advantages over those who dismiss it entirely. Yet, as revolutionary as it is, fully adopting it overnight would be reckless and impossible.

**Remember:** When cars were invented, they didn't magically have roads and traffic rules in 10 years. It took generations to build the infrastructure, establish safety standards, and integrate them into daily life for their actual benefits to materialize.

Same goes here.

This technology allows people who don't trust each other—even people who have betrayed each other—to find new ways of coordinating. To say: "Let's try again, but this time we'll use datasync technologies like CDNs to minimize trust requirements."

**That's the promise.** Not perfection. Not utopia. Just new tools for an old problem: how to coordinate when trust is scarce.

## From Bit to Bitcoin

And so we return to where we started—but you're not the same person who opened this book.

You began with a light switch, wondering what a "bit" really meant. Now you understand how that simple on-or-off distinction scales into global coordination technology. You've seen how cryptography creates trust between strangers, how consensus emerges from chaos, and how code can enforce agreements that words alone cannot.

More importantly, you've learned to think clearly about complex systems. Not to accept buzzwords at face value. Not to dismiss what you don't understand. But to ask: *What problem does this actually solve? What are the trade-offs? Who controls what?*

This matters beyond crypto. The same mental tools—breaking down complexity, questioning assumptions, seeing through hype—apply everywhere: to AI, to social media algorithms, to any technology that shapes your life while hiding its mechanics.

The oligarchy of nerds is real, and it will grow. But now you're better equipped to question us. To hold us accountable. To participate in decisions about technologies that affect you. That's not nothing—that's exactly what Robert Michels said the masses need.

**This knowledge is yours now. Share it. Use it. Build with it.**

From you to the future.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
