# 🧠 Excerpts From This Book

### On Money & Meaning 💸🐒

- *"If we can assign meaning to bits, why not assign them the meaning of money?"*

- *"Gold has value because people agree it does. The US Dollar has value because people agree it does. Bitcoin has value because people agree it does. Value in big complex societies predominantly becomes social consensus. It always has been."*

- *"The bits themselves? Meaningless. But the coordinated interpretation of those bits? That creates money, contracts, organizations, entire economies."*

### On Human Coordination 🤝

- *"This is the revolution in how we trust. A revolution in one of the deepest aspects that dictate how we, as a species, coordinate."*

- *"This technology allows humans to do things that were literally, physically impossible before 2009."*

### On Power & Control 💥

- *"Banks control your money. They can freeze accounts, reverse transactions, and deny service. You had no choice but to trust them."*

- *"You had to trust them. There was no alternative."*

- *"Governments do this. Corporations do this. Abusers do this. They delete records. They change documents. They deny things happened. And if you can't prove it, you are powerless."*

- *"No one can hide tyranny. No one can erase the past. At least the economic history."*

### On What Was Impossible 🌟

- *"All of these things were physically impossible. And then, starting in 2009 with Bitcoin, they slowly became possible. Not easy. Not perfect. But possible. That is already a leap of infinite size."*

### On Technology & Humanity 🤖

- *"What we build with these new capabilities will define whether this technology becomes a net positive or just another tool for the powerful."*

- *"It's up to us—not developers, not governments, not corporations—all of us."*

### On Understanding vs Hype 🤔

- *"I realized: If we really want people to feel comfortable with 'crypto,' we cannot skip the complexity. We must break it down as much as possible and teach it. So we don't sound like scammers no matter what we say."*

- *"We, the nerds—the ones who build the code, who can read the code, who can write the code—will become a strong oligarchy if this technology is massively adopted. We must educate what Robert Michels calls 'the masses'—the everyday people—so they can question us and make the system even more resilient to corruption and power abuse."*

- *"This book's main goal: teach people to think correctly about these new technologies that shape and influence our lives, from the bit to Bitcoin, so they can know what they are and how to use them safely."*
